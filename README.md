# MECH
This repo consists of various projects I have completed that were related to my mechanical engineering education
## BAJASim
This is a simulation I whipped up to see how changing gear ratios would affect our vehicles top speed and acceleration.
I learned a bunch about graphing in Python because of this simulation.
## MECH Resources Website
While I was taking a beginner udemy web design course, I had an idea for a website that would let MECH students share 
study aids. I wanted it to be really simple to navigate.
Although I didn't complete the project while working on it I learned a bunch about HTML, CSS and PHP. 
## WaterJetRCCar
During MECH2 I created a MATLAB simulation for our waterjet propelled RC Car, which used a bunch of the fluid dynamics and thermo concepts I had learned in my 2nd year. The simulation allow our team to really narrow down the parameters we needed to test and 
helped predict our performance during the competition which was a scoring criteria where we did excellent in.
As I was just starting to learn python, I decided to port over my MATLAB code to python for fun.
